I2C (Inter IC Communication) or due to legal issues with Philips 
sometimes called TWI (Two Wire Interface) has:

- Two Wires for Connection: Clock, Data (serial)
- Adress for each connected Element
- Master/Slave 
- 8 Bit oriented
- Max Freq. is 3.4 MHz

Master does:

- initialize
- clock
- terminate

Wire Names (typically)
- SCL -> Signal Clock
- SDA -> Signal Data

Wires are bidirectional and have a pull-up resistor.

Data has to be constant during each clock pulse.

Start and End of transmission is signaled with a condition.

Start Condition: SDA H -> L during H SCL
End Condition:   SDA L -> H during H SCL

Every passed byte has to be ACKnowledged.
Data has to be sended with MSB first.

Clock Stretching possible for slow Slaves.

I2C sends Data within Packages with usually 9 Bit.
-> Adresspackage
-> Datapackage

First Byte after Start Condition is usually Address of Slave.
(Only Exception is general call)

Addresspackage:
[x x x x x x x] [x] [x]
7 Bits Address  R/W ACK

Read: High, Write: Low
ACK: Low

ACK is sent by Receiver

If Master is Receiver all Packages except the last are ACKed.
If Slave is Receiver all Packages including the last are ACKed.

Slave System Clock should be around 16x faster than I2C Clock.
